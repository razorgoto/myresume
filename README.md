myresume
========

This a draft form of my resume hosted on github. I am also doing this as a way to learn Git and Markdown. Using git to manage this gives me a better workflow when trying to learn vim on the commandline. I also think that it is nifty.

Special thanks to my friend Jason for pointing out the use of a Make file for Pandoc to HTML conversion.
