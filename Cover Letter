Hi, 

I am writing to apply for the position of Professional Development Coordinator that I found on your website. (JOB: 14-069)

 have 7 years of experience working in a training and learning environment. I was responsible for initiating new training programs as a part of the rollout of several ERP systems. I was also responsible for multiple, externally-audited, quality programs.

Please review my attached resume, and let me know if you have any questions or would like any more information about my qualifications or if you would like to my references. 

I am available to start this position two weeks after a job offer has been accepted. 

I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks very much for your time. 

Best regards, 

Sammy Lao
